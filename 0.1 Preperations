Preperations for the use of this code:

- this app is developed on a rapsberry pi2 with an raspian wheezy installed
- make sure your raspian is up to date and your firmware is actual
'sudo apt-get update'
'sudo apt-get rpi-update'

If you get asked for reboot, do it.

The scripts used for the webserver requires an apache 2.2.22 with php and mysql installed.
The scripts used for the temperature probes based on perl and wgpio. Make sure you have the package installed.
The scripts used for the webcam snapshots using fswebcam. Easy to use. Install it. There is no add. configuration needed.
The scripts used for the power switch control are based on a gembird controlled device that requires the sispmctl package installed to control the switches.

I am still experiencing issues in the running processes, based on longterm behaviors of the wheezy.


A list of hardware i use:

- raspberry pi2
- 32Gb SD Card class 10
- Ehternet 100mbit/s Internetconnection
- Logitech C300 USB Webcam
- DS18B20 Probes, waterproof, 3m wire
- Gembird EG-PMS2 Power Switch
- EC probe with BNC connector
- pH probe with BNC connector
- sparkywidget microcontrollerboad 

The configuration described here in this repository does not work unmodified on an Jessie Distribution!!!!!!!
