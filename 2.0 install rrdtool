we need a database that record all our values that we measure with our DS18S20 Probes. I use rrdtool to update an existing round robin database (rrd).

First install rrdtool

'sudo apt-get install rrdtool'

then create the databases you need. (i use for every single value a single database. Modify this behavior as you like) I like to use a shell script that will create my db.
create a file named create_db.sh in a folder of your choice (here /etc/rrd/ for the first value:

#!/bin/bash
rrdtool create hometemp.rrd --start N --step 300 \
DS:temp:GAUGE:600:U:U \
DS:outtemp:GAUGE:600:U:U \
RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1:12 \
RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1:288 \
RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:12:168 \
RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:12:720 \
RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:288:365 \

To see an overview of the rrd tool syntax visit http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/ - there are all flags listed you can use for the arrays.
It is the rrdtool website, created by Tobias Oetiker. I 'd like to say thank you to Tobias for this easy to use tool.

change the owner of this file:
'sudo chown username create_db.sh'

make it executeable:
'sudo chmod +x create_db.sh

run the script:
'sh /etc/rrd/create_db.sh'

you will find a file named hometemp.rrd in the folder /etc/rrd/ after running this script. The first value we read from our sensors will be written 
with timestamp in our database. From there we can write this value into variables and use them further with a simple perl script.
