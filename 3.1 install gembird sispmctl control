#For the control of the power switches i use a 4-channel gembirg device with an USB Port (GEM EG-PM2). It is cheap and works reliable since 2 years.
#Thats the main cause i use them. There a lot of ways to control power switches but this is the easiest way with the minimum amount of cables and boards.

#First we download the package:

'wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/sispmctl/files/sispmctl/sispmctl-3.1/sispmctl-3.1.tar.gz'

#unpack it

'tar xzvf sispm_ctl-*.tar.gz'

#compile the sispmctl

'cd sispm_ctl-*'

'./configure'

'make'

'sudo make install'

#To make a control possible we need to install the libusb-dev paket.

'sudo apt-get install libusb-dev'

#Connect the gembird switch with an USB A cable to a USB port of your raspberry.
# control your power switches now with the following commands

sudo sispmctl -o 4

# the flag -o 4 means switch on the plug 4.

sudo sispmctl -f 3

# switch off power plug 3 with the flag -f 3

# i use this command in the crontab to control the switch times of my devices.(see 4.0 automate tasks... In some cases it is usefull to use this command for 
# emergency shutoffs. I plan the use of sensors that are able to monitor the water levels and switch off the pumps if something went wrong. lets see what happen
