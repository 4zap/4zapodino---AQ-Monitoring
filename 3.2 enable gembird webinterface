#if the file sispmctl is compiled you can start a webservice to switch the plug manually.
#start this interface with the binding to your IP address and the IP port (in this case port 8080)

'sudo sispmctl -i 192.168.1.1 -p 8080m -l'


Web server will bind on interface with IP 192.168.1.1
Server will listen on port 8080.
Server goes to listen mode now.
Try to bind to 192.168.1.1

When you now open http://192.168.1.1:8080 in your browser you will see the 4 channel plug and can manually control the power off and power on of every plug.
