For the USB issue with the Logitech webcam (capturing fails after a few snapshots) we  need to reset the USB port where the webcam is connected with.
Download the following file into your home directory:

'wget -c --no-check-certificate https://gist.githubusercontent.com/x2q/5124616/raw/3f6e5f144efab2bc8e9d02b95b8301e1e0eab669/usbreset.c -O usbreset.c'

compile C to file usbreset

'cc usbreset.c -o usbreset'

make it executeable

'sudo chmod +x usbreset'

now you can execute usbreset with the following command

'sudo ./usbreset /dev/bus/usb/001/009'

this will reset the USB Port 009 on BUS 001. To determine on which port the webcam is connected try:
'
bs=`lsusb | grep Logitech | cut -c5-7`
dve=`lsusb | grep Logitech | cut -c16-18
echo "Webcam connected to BUS" $bs ", port" $dve
'

to reset the USB port you can use

'sudo usbreset /dev/bus/usb/$bs/$dve'

This part is already included to the file "start_webcam.sh". There is no need to specifiy this task anymore. this is just to explain how it works.
